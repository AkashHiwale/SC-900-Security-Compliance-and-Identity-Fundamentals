# üõ°Ô∏è Defense in Depth

**Defense in Depth** is a cybersecurity strategy that uses multiple layers of defense to protect systems and data from attacks. The goal is to ensure that if one layer is compromised, others still provide protection.

## üß± What is Defense in Depth?

Defense in Depth is a **multi-layered approach** where security controls are implemented at various points in the IT environment. This slows down or stops attackers and limits the impact of a breach.

Each layer offers a specific function and builds redundancy into the system‚Äôs protection mechanisms.

## üß© Key Security Layers

| Layer                        | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Physical Security**        | Secures physical access to data centers, offices, and devices               |
| **Perimeter Security**       | Firewalls, DDoS protection, and VPNs to secure the network edge             |
| **Network Security**         | Network segmentation, NSGs, and threat detection systems                    |
| **Endpoint Security**        | Antivirus, EDR (e.g., Microsoft Defender for Endpoint) on user devices      |
| **Application Security**     | Controls at the app level: input validation, authentication, WAF            |
| **Data Security**            | Data encryption, classification, and loss prevention                       |
| **Identity and Access Control** | MFA, Conditional Access, RBAC to restrict access to resources              |
| **Monitoring and Response**  | SIEM systems like Microsoft Sentinel for detecting and responding to threats|

## üìù Exam Tips

- Defense in Depth is a layered security model used to mitigate threats at multiple levels.
- Understand how Microsoft solutions align with each layer:
  - Azure DDoS Protection ‚Üí Perimeter Security
  - Network Security Groups (NSG) ‚Üí Network Security
  - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint ‚Üí Endpoint Security
  - Azure Application Gateway (WAF) ‚Üí Application Security
  - Microsoft Purview Information Protection / DLP ‚Üí Data Security
  - Microsoft Entra ID + MFA ‚Üí Identity and Access Control
  - Microsoft Sentinel ‚Üí Monitoring and Response
- The exam may test your ability to **match security services with their corresponding layers**.
- This concept supports the broader Zero Trust architecture.
